# term-meta-ui

WordPress plugin. Provides a user interface for reading and writing term meta data.

If you've used `wp-admin/options.php` to view or edit options, this works similarly for taxonomy term meta values.

## Screenshot

This screenshot shows the bottom of `wp-admin/term.php` where a Term Meta UI section is added.
